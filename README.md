# StereoSiTE - Spatial Transcriptome Analysis in Python 

**StereoSiTE** is a package for the analysis and visualization of spatial transcriptome data.
It builds on top of `anndata`, `scanpy` and `scanpy`, from which it inherits modularity and scalability.
It provides analysis tools to dissect cellular neighborhood based on cell composition and quantitatively define cell-cell communication in spatial.
